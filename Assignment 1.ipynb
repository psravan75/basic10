    "->Python's popularity as a programming language stems from several key features that make it accessible, versatile, and powerful:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Readability*: Python's clean and simple syntax makes it easy to read and write, enhancing code maintainability.\n",
    "2. *Versatility*: It's used in web development, data analysis, AI, automation, and more.\n",
    "3. *Extensive Libraries*: Python has a rich standard library and numerous third-party packages that extend its functionality.\n",
    "4. *Cross-Platform*: Python runs on multiple operating systems without modification.\n",
    "5. *Strong Community*: A large, active community provides support, resources, and continuous improvement.\n",
    "6. *Interpreted Language*: Python executes code line by line, enabling quick testing and debugging.\n",
    "7. *Dynamic Typing*: Variables don't require explicit data type declarations, allowing flexible coding.\n",
    "8. *Integration*: Python easily integrates with other languages and technologies.\n",

    "- *Control Flow*: if x > 5: print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n",
    "- *Function Definition*: def greet(name): return \"Hello, \" + name\n",
